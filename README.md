A projet [under construction] for plotting data with statistical tests inspired from JASP (https://jasp-stats.org/)

# Done :
    - Bar plot with manual correlation bracket annotation for grouped or not grouped data
    - Read xls files

# To Do :
    - clean code (usless vars and better way with dataframe storage)
    - implement statistical test
    - auto-label bar plot with correlation starts using stats results
    - method for access mutliples file format (csv, xls, ...)
    - Other types of graph (line, etc...)
